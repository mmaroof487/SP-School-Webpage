      <p>In the New Normal, a question remains:  how long will this masked appearance continue? Look at the realities!
         Kashmir experienced complete alienation from the rest of the world for few months in 2019. This man-made calamity was somehow overtaken by the natural calamity 
         of the Pandemic.COVID kept apart the dear ones from each other while in many cases separated each other forever without even giving them a chance to bid adieu.

      <p> A new form of administration in Jammu & Kashmir sans political parties and elections continues.
         A new mode of schooling, business and economic activities have been adopted and has become part of normal life.
         Competitions, Public examinations and the Service Selection process have almost come to a standstill leaving the future of a generation so bleak and uncertain.

      <p>Qualifying without the practical know-how being assessed, ie; relying merely on the theoretical knowledge will have an adverse impact 
         on society in the days to come. Millions of jobs are lost and the lives of millions across the world have turned out utterly miserable.
         Unfortunately the number of orphans - children or adults - is bound to be a great concern of the caring Governments and the people of goodwill.

      <p>The reason behind all these? Perhaps the uncaring attitude towards God's beautiful world and the pride of money for which God planned to teach the humanity a lesson  -->
         unforgettable. Yet if predictions come true of a third wave of COVID in another mutant form, we will also be forced to adopt new behaviours.
         So the new normal must open our eyes and take us into an Era of Realization.
